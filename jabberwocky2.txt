2:       Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
3: All mimsy were the borogoves,
4:       And the mome raths outgrabe.
5: 
6: "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
7:       The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
8: Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
9:       The frumious Bandersnatch!"
10: 
11: He took his vorpal sword in hand;
12:       Long time the manxome foe he sought--
13: So rested he by the Tumtum tree
14:       And stood awhile in thought.
15: 
16: And, as in uffish thought he stood,
17:       The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
18: Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
19:       And burbled as it came!
20: 
21: One, two! One, two! And through and through
22:       The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
23: He left it dead, and with its head
24:       He went galumphing back.
25: 
26: "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
27:       Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
28: O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
29:       He chortled in his joy.
30: 
31: 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
32:       Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
33: All mimsy were the borogoves,
34:       And the mome raths outgrabe.
