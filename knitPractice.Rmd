```

## 1a: Read the modified usnews.csv into R. Check the first few values of each vector.

```
usnews <- read.csv("C:/Users/Deanna/Documents/grad school/DS710/ds710fall2017assignment9-Brisbin/usnews_clean")

head(usnews)
```
usnews <- read.csv("C:/Users/Deanna/Documents/grad school/DS710/ds710fall2017assignment9-Brisbin/usnews_clean")

head(usnews)


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
